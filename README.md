Movies file attached with format valid entries for testing.
Movies viewed on the Gui are per AVL tree, the app was structured as follows:
Each movie is its own object, with a Movie catalog (Hash table of AVL trees) and an extremely basic GUI using Java-FX that views a tree's contents and no other with basic actions.
This was a test of understanding of the Hash Table and AVL tree structures and general OOP, with very strict guidelines to how it is to be made down to the smallest details.
A different -and better- approach would be categorizing by genre, where each genre is its own AVL tree, and no height limitation. with better search options and better navigation based on existing genres.
This maintains the fast lookup time and makes the app user friendly. with the addition of other sorting options (rating, title, date of release).
With fixing the GUI and input / output layouts for better user experience
